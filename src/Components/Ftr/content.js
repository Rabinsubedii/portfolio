                Abstract
Hospital infection is a major problem in public health as there are numbers of patients in hospitals due to which the death rate of patients are increasing. Infection due to the carelessness in washing hand is a foremost reason of spreading the communicable diseases from a person to another person. Keeping hands sanitized is one of the vital step that one can take to keep himself and his patient safe from getting sick and dissemination of microorganisms to others. Various infections and illnesses are communicated from one to another person by carelessly not washing hands. Health professionals should implement the hand cleanliness in advance when contacting the patient, before cleaning or handling the sterile, or after revealing to the fluids coming from the body of the patient, or after contacting the patient and also after the interaction with the patient's belongings, surroundings or any materials. Medical Professionals must be conscious of the procedures of properly hand cleaning method with water and soap. Health Care Professional should be trained to wash their hand properly before start working in the hospital or any health care area. After washing the hands, they should maintain the strategy that helps them not to get infected again. This can be done by using the method of using clean tissue paper, towel, after washing the hands. 
 
Introduction 
Infection due to the carelessness in washing hand is a foremost reason of suffering from a medical condition which some time may cause death as well. Handwashing is a most important task that should be strictly followed by a health professionals. Hand washing can be referred to Hand Hygiene which is a process to clean hand using a soap and water which aids in removing virus, infection and other harmful foreign bodies. Harmful germs from unwashed hands will be able to get into foodstuffs while people cook or eat them. They can then multiply themselves in some types of foods or drinks, under certain circumstances, and make people sick. Treating one sick person and shifting to another patients without washing hands is way more dangerous than one can assume. Patients can be contaminated due to the carelessness of health workers which may results in diarrhea, skin infection, eye infection, respiratory infection as well as the most dangerous, fatal and highly communicable disease called Covid 19. ("Show Me the Science - Why Wash Your Hands?", 2020). Infection prevention and Control (IPC) is a practical, evidence-based approach which prevents patients and health workers from being harmed by avoidable infection and as a result of antimicrobial resistance. The importance of hand hygiene is huge 
because it aids in preventing infections that are associated to patient’s care directly or indirectly. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian obstetrician is known to be the first to explore the antiseptic procedures. He discovered that childbed fever (puerperal fever) was transmittable and it could be lessen by following the proper hand washing techniques by medical care givers.

Literature Review
The WHO approximates that about 5 million nosocomial infection in Europe occur each year which are responsible for about 25 million extra days in hospital. As a medical professional, these infections are unavoidable most of the time, but regular handwashing and sanitization is an easy, practical, and most important way to fight against it. Hand Cleanliness has always been the solitary important way that can lessen the spread of bacteria, virus, germs, disease and infection in hospitals. Now, with the Covid-19 pandemic, the essentials of handwashing has been known around the world. ("The Importance of Hand Hygiene, the Importance of Hand Hygiene", 2021). Washing hands appropriately is one and only the best important method with which we can help avoid and control the transmission of many diseases. Proper Hand Washing will decrease the threat like flu, food poisoning, viral infection and other healthcare related infections that are being transferred from person to person. Hand Hygiene can also aid break the dissemination of infections like Covid - 19 when visiting someone in hospital or another health care area. ("Hand Washing and hand hygiene | nidirect", 2021). Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian obstetrician instituted out the antiseptic technique in which he has suggested to use a solution of chlorinated lime before autopsy and before visiting the patient, which drastically changed the mortality rate. The death rate in first clinic was dropped by 90%. Before using this technique the mortality rate was 18.3% which was dropped to 2.2% then 1.2% and then 0% after two months of following his technique. ("Medicine in stamps-Ignaz Semmelweis and Puerperal Fever", 2013). Handwashing is a keystone of preventing COVID 19 as well. Amidst pandemic, handwashing plays a key role to lessen the spread of the virus, not only for patients but also for Health Care Professionals. Hand washing should be taken as important part of everyday routine, and should be done frequently after doing some work or shifting to another work. ("Handwashing an effective tool to prevent COVID-19, other diseases", 2020). About 50% of the communicable disease are likely to be transmitted from caregiver to patient, due to the less hand hygiene and about 80% from one person to another (may or may not be care givers). So hand washing should be done before or after visiting the patient, after taking off the gloves, preparing medicine or foods, before or after using medical instrument like stethoscope, syringe, sphygmomanometer, or any other equipment. After washing the hands properly, care givers need to rub their hands in clean tissue paper or cloth, or dry their hands in electric air drier. ("Handwashing: Care Instruction", 2020). A TV show host named Pete Hegseth told in media that he hasn’t washed his hand in 10 years, which was a shocking words to be heard in the media, told by the people of one the world’s developed country, USA. ("'Germs are not a real thing': Fox News host says he hasn't washed hands in 10 years | Fox News | The Guardian", 2019). This shows that, even if someone is educated or a big media person, he/she may not know the fact that handwashing is one of the simplest and the most effective method to stop transmittable infection. But as a Health Care Professional, everyone should wash their hand frequently, not only for us, also for others, so that we all can be safe form the infection. We as a care giver need to teach them about the importance of hand washing. According to the Centers for Disease control and Prevention (CDC), the best and proper way to get rid of germs, sickness, prevent the infection from one person to another, is proper hand washing.
